#Linked List Algorithm in java 
In Java, a LinkedList is a data structure that stores elements in a non-contiguous location. It is a linear data structure.
Each data item is called a ‘Node’ and each node has a data part and an address part. The address part stores the link to the next node in 
the LinkedList
