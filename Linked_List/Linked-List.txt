#Linked List Algorithm in java 
/**In Java, a LinkedList is a data structure that stores elements in a non-contiguous location. It is a linear data structure.
Each data item is called a ‘Node’ and each node has a data part and an address part. The address part stores the link to the next node in 
the LinkedList

In this post, methods to insert a new node in the linked list are discussed. A node can be added in three ways 

At the front of the linked list  
After a given node. 
At the end of the linked list.

In this we can see how to join the node at front of linked list **/
